The computer will generate a number between 1 and 100

var rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100) + 1;

Then the computer asks the user to guess the number

If the user guesses too high, the computer says, "too high!"
						low, the computer says, "too low!"

If the user guesses just right, the computer says, "You Win!" and generates another number.


Optional:
1. Make it look good!
2. Give the user a certain number of guesses before they lose
