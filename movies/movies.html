		 Hey! This is where you'll write your code.

		 The variable rentalsArray contains all of the rentals in the format:
		 "Username Movie# Month"

		 For example:
		 "User2 43 March"

		 Which means that "User2" rented movie number 43 (The Pianist) in March. You don't have
		 the list of movie IDs yet - that's for tomorrow's homework!

		 Your job is to answer the two questions:
		 Which user had the most checkouts in 2014?
		 Which month had the most checkouts in 2014?

		 Okay! Let's figure out which user had the most checkouts!

		 First you'll want to go through the array, which is composed of strings,
		 and figure out how to get just the parts you want.
		 */

		/*
		 Now that we have our data in a consumable format, we just need to iterate through the
		 arrays and keep track of which user had the most checkouts.

		 Hint: You'll probably need to create at least one more array to keep track of checkout counts per user or per month.

		 Write your code to calculate the answers, and put the answers in place of the "???" below.
