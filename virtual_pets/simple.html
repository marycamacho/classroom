		/**
			Your homework:
				* Create an HTML button to feed the virtual pet by calling view.feed();
				* Create some other vital statistic for the virtual pet (hitpoints, cuddles, fur thickness, etc.). Create an html button (or two) which manipulates this stat.
				* Instead of logging to the console, create some HTML which displays the current status of your virtual pet.

			Optional Extra Work:
				* Have the virtual pet's hunger increase over time
				* Also make sure you don't overfeed it
				* Create a system for managing other statistics about your virtual pet
				* Create a small image or other graphic which represents your virtual pet
				* Create the ability to have more than one virtual pet at a time
