This weekend, create an ADDRESS BOOK using the techniques we learned today. This is a very open-ended assignment, use whatever techniques you feel you need practice on to complete the requirements.

Alternatively, create some other application which uses at least three constructor functions and is approximately the same scope as the address book.

Requirements for the ADDRESS BOOK:
	Store People and Businesses
	Search by name or phone number
	Add people or businesses to the address book

Optional:
	Make it look pretty. Use Bootstrap or another framework.
	Implement localstorage so your address book persists across page refreshes

Reminder:
	C - create
	R - read
	U - update
	D - delete
